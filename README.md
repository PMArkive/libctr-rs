# libctr-rs

This is a rust version of libctru, with some C bindings to libctru.

The goals of this project are to:

- Get a good rust IPC system in place for rust projects
- Provide a way to mock libctru behavior so tests can be written for homebrew and run on any machine
- Fix a few issues with pure libctru C bindings (some structs, such as `Mii`, aren't currently compatible with rust, and split arm/thumb builds aren't possible, which causes issues with the inlined IPC functions)

Whether this borrows more from libctru in the future or removes libctru/ctry_sys as a dependency in the future is unknown at this time.

## Building

Building requires std to be built along with core and alloc. To build pass the following command or use the provided make file.

```
cargo build -Z build-std --target armv6k-nintendo-3ds
```

## Mocks and testing

Unit tests are important to ensure changes don't accidentally break functionality and to serve as documentation. Most 3ds homebrew does not include unit tests due to 3ds specific mechanics.

One of this crate's goals is to provide mock functions with stubbed responses when the target OS is not Horizon. Because the libctr-rs mocks are target agnostic and ctru_sys is not included when the target OS is not Horizon, any homebrew using this library should be able to write test that will run on any target.

When writing tests that require a libctr-rs function to have a specific return value (e.g. an error), mocktopus can be used to mock whatever response is needed.

## Assumptions and contribution requirements

This crate has a few assumptions about its host:

- Any code not compiled for Horizon must be mocks for tests
- The host machine is at least a 32 bit host

Requirements:

- All code must support 64 bit machines, as those are common to run tests on
- All code should be agnostic to the host endianness
- All structs should derive `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, and `Default` when possible
- All structs should be `repr(C)` or `repr(primitive)`
- All impls and functions should be mockable with mocktopus
